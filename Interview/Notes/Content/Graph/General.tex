For me it is a ''new'' topic, I know a little bit about it but I dont know as much as I want so a decided to get a deeper knowledge about graphs.

\paragraph{Graph theory}
Is the mathematical theory of the properties and applications of graphs (networks)\\

To understand a little bit more this imagine that you have a set of accesories to wear. Things to put in your head, in ypur body and in your legs. So we need to solve the next question, How many different sets of clothing can I make by choosing an article from each category? Using mathematics we can solve this problem but a graph can help us to solve this visually.

Other common problem is how many friends does the person X have? or how many degrees of separation are there between person X and Y?

\subsection{Types of graphs}

To solve particular problems is necessarilyto know the type of graph that we need to code, and we have different types of graphs each can help us to solve something in particular.

\subsubsection{Undirected graph}
It's the simplest type of graph. An undirected graph is a graph which edges have no orientation. The edge (u, v) is identical to the edge (v, u). Maybe is better if we have a draw:


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2]
    \tikzstyle{every node}+=[inner sep=0pt]
    \draw [black] (8.9,-26.5) circle (3);
    \draw (8.9,-26.5) node {$A$};
    \draw [black] (27.1,-18.1) circle (3);
    \draw (27.1,-18.1) node {$B$};

    \draw [black] (42.6,-27.3) circle (3);
    \draw (42.6,-27.3) node {$D$};
    \draw [black] (59.8,-16.7) circle (3);
    \draw (59.8,-16.7) node {$E$};
    \draw [black] (61.6,-36.1) circle (3);

'\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Directed graph}
A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations. For example, the edge (u, v) is the edge from node u to v.

    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.2]

\subsection{Weighted graphs}
Many graphs can have edges that contain a certain weigh to represent an arbitrary value such a cost, distance quantity, etc... 
Something important to know is that an edge will be represented as a triplet (u, v, w) and specify whether the graph is directed or undirected.

\subsection{Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)}
DAGs are directed graphs with no cycles. These graphs play an important role in representing structures with dependencies. Several efficient algorithms exits to operates on DAGs.
\textbf{IMPORTANT:} All out-trees are DAGs but not all DAGs are out-trees.

Other definitions exist such as: the graph is two colourable or there is no odd lenght cycle.

\subsection{¿How can we represent a graph?}

If we build an adjacency matrix using the graph above, we have the next as a result
$
    \begin{bheadmatrix}[A & B &C &D][*{4}{r}]
        0 & 4 & 1 & 9 \\
        3 & 0 & 6 & 11 \\
        4 & 1 & 0 & 2\\
        6 & 5 & -4 & 0
    \end{bheadmatrix}%    
$

\textbf{NOTE:} It is often assumed that the edge of going from a node to itself has a cost of zero.\\

Now we need to know why is better or not to use an adjacency matrix

\subsubsection{Adjacency list}
An adjacency list is a way to represent a graph as a map from nodes to lists of edges

    \draw [black] (50.96,-15.397) arc (-80.11315:-99.88685:54.223);

    \draw [black] (50.999,-43.762) arc (-77.30143:-102.69857:42.53);
    \fill [black] (51,-43.76) -- (50.11,-43.45) -- (50.33,-44.43);
    \draw (41.65,-45.3) node [below] {$2$};

    \draw (32.1,-28.9) node [right] {$4$};
    \draw [black] (53.027,-17.669) arc (-18.94912:-63.01873:42.486);
    \fill [black] (53.03,-17.67) -- (52.29,-18.26) -- (53.24,-18.59);
    \draw (45.46,-33.19) node [right] {$1$};

    \draw (39.99,-26.48) node [left] {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}        
\end{figure}

If we made a list we have the next as a result: 

A -> [(B, 4), (C,1)]\par
B -> [(C,6)]\par
C -> [(A,4),(B,1),(D,2)]\par
D -> []\par

Let's take the node C as an example. As we can see the node C can reach with nodes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Node A with cost 4}
    \item {Node B with cost 1}
    \item {Node D with cost 2}
\end{itemize}

As we made with the adjacency matrix we have some cons and pros for this representation:

\begin{table}[H]

    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
    \begin{tabular}{ll}

                                                                                               & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Slightly more complex graph\\ representation\end{tabular} \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}%
    }
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Edge list}
An edge list is a way to represent a graph simply as an unordered list of edges. Assume the notation for any triplet (u, v, w) means:
''the cost from node u to node v is w''

If we take the same graph as the adjacent list and make a transformation of this graph to an edge list we get the next:

\[
    [(C,A,4), (A,C,1), (B,C,6), (A,B,4), (C,B,1), (C,D,2)]
\]

This representation is seldomly used because of its lack of structure. However, it is conceptually simple and practical in a handful algorithms.

As the last representations we have some cons and pros for the edge list:

\subsection{Common graph theory problems}

\subsubsection{How can we solve graph theory problems?}
Is necessarily ask yourself:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {Is the graph directed or undirected?}
    \item {Are the edges of the graph weighted?}
    \item {Is the graph I will encounter likely to be sparse or dense with edges?}
    \item {Should I use an adjacency matrix, adjacency list, an edge list or other structure to represent the graph efficiently?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Shortest path problem}
Given a weighted graph, find the shortest path of edges from node A to node B.

\textbf{Algorithms:} BFS (unweighted graph), Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, A*, and many more...
