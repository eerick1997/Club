\subsubsection{Overview}
The Depth First Search (DFS) is the most fundamental search algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It runs with a time complexity of $O(V+E)$ and is often used as a building block in other algorithms.\\

By itself the DFS is not all that useful, but when augmented to perform other tasks such as count connected components, determine connectivity, or find bridges / articulation points then DFS really shines.


\subsubsection{Basic DFS}
As the name suggest, a DFS plunges depth first into a graph without regard for which edge it takes next until it cannot go any further at which point it backtracks and continues.\\

Lets give an example using the next graph

Then the DFS moves through an edge and goes to another node, for example node 9, then node 8, then node 7, then node 10, then node 11 and again node 7

    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

We already visited the node 7, so we need to return using backtracking an visit the rest of neighbours of node 7 so we continue doing the DFS but in another direction and we put a mark in the nodes that we already visited but are not valid.
