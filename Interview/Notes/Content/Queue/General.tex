As the Stack we already know the basic operations of a Queue, so we have an idea about what we go to program, but what is the structure of a Queue? As I mentioned before maybe show a draw or schema is better to understand what we need to program so I have maked a little draw of how I imagine a Queue.

As you can see a stack has a ''back'' and ''front'' element where ''back'' is the last element of the queue and ''front'' is the first element. Each element (lets call them as nodes) has a value and a pointer to the next element, if we wrote this using code we have the next result:

\begin{lstlisting}
    #include <bits/stdc++.h>

    using namespace std;

    struct Node{
        int value;
        Node *next;

        Node( int _value ){
            value = _value;
            next = NULL;
        }
    };

    struct Queue{

        Node *back;
        Node *front;
        int size;

        Queue(){
            back = front = NULL;
            size = 0;
        }

        void Enqueue( int value ){
            Node *node = new Node( value );
            if( size == 0 )
                back = front = node;
            else {
                node -> next = back;
                back = node;
            }

            size++;
        }

        void Dequeue(){
            Node *aux = back;
            if( size > 1 ){
                
                while( aux -> next != NULL )
                    aux = aux -> next;

                aux -> next = NULL;
                front = aux;

            } else if( size == 1 )
                front = back = NULL;
            else 
                return;
            size--;
        }

        bool IsEmpty(){
            return (size == 0);
        }

        int Top(){
            return (front -> value);
        }

        int GetSize(){
            return size;
        }
        
        void print(){
            cout << endl;
            Node *aux = back;
            while( aux != NULL ){
                cout << aux -> value << " ";
                aux = aux -> next;
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    };
\end{lstlisting}
