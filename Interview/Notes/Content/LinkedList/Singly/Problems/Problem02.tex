To solve this problem we can use the history of the hare and the turtle, as we know the hare is too fast and the turtle too slow, let's say that the hare is two times faster than the turtle, if we have a cycle both will meet at some point, if we code this the turtle is a ponter to head and moves using turtle = turtle -> next and the hare is hare = head -> next -> next, and moves hare = hare -> next -> next
