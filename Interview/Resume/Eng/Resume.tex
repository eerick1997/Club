    \project{Exploration of complex discrete universes using two-dimensional cellular automata.}{
        Cellular automata has a lot of applications, from describing the behaviour of a colony of ants to describing the behaviour of virus propagation. But the study of two-dimensional cellular automata of Von Neumann type is a little so we want to make a research about this type of automata and make a classification of the rules that this automata has and find the relationship between the rules and dynamic systems.

\resumesection{\faBriefcase}{Experience}
\experienceitem{Professional Practices}{Banco de México (Bank of Mexico)}{
    Worked in a system to generate automaticlly reports getting the information from all the departments using SSRS that works with \textbf{Visual Basic} and it is powered by \textbf{SQL Server} and \textbf{Sharepoint}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {Software performance was optimized rewriting some recursive code and avoiding consulting a lot of times information.}
        \item {Created new reports that allow analysis of new projects and know the current state of each project.}
    \end{itemize}

\project{\link{Virtual Spaces Manager}{https://gitlab.com/ArmandTavera/ingenieriadesoftware3cm2/tree/Arturo-Analisis}}
{This aplication was developed in order to more efficiently register virtual spaces of the \link{'Polytechnic Unit for Virtual Education' (UPEV)}{https://www.ipn.mx/upev/} developed using \textbf{JavaScript} and documented using \textbf{\LaTeX}.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
    \item {Collaborated in a team of 30 persons in which I had the role of analyst.}
    \item {Created some documentation to this project like use cases, class diagrams, BPMN diagrams, bussiness rules, etc.}
    \item {Created \textbf{\LaTeX} templates to make the documentation easier to do.}
\end{itemize}
\project{\link{Sübguey}{https://github.com/eerick1997/Subguey}}{
    Mobile application created to make easier to travel by subway or metrobus in Mexico City. Developed using \textbf{Java} for Android to backend and \textbf{XML} to frontend in a team of 5 members. The objetive of this project was inform in real time on events within these means of transport and allow the user to decide whether to take an alternative path to arrive to their destination or take another type of transport.
