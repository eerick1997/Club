https://leetcode.com/problems/leftmost-column-with-at-least-a-one/

Given a binary matrix which every row is sorted in non-decreasing order return the leftmost column index with at least a 1 in it.

You canâ€™t access the Binary Matrix directly. You may only access the matrix using a BinaryMatrix interface:

-BinaryMatrix.get(x, y) returns the element of the matrix at index (x, y) (0-indexed).

-BinaryMatrix.dimensions() returns a vector of 2 elements [m, n], which means the matrix is m * n.

Example 1:

matrix = [[0,0], 
		  [1,1]]

output: 0


Example 2:
matrix = [[0,0], 
		  [0,1]]

output: 1


Example 3:
matrix = [[0,0,0,1], 
		  [0,0,1,1],
		  [0,1,1,1]]

output: 1


Constraints:
Matrix can be empty
Matrix dimensions at most 1000 x 1000

Accepted solutions
Runtime: O(nlogm) or O(n + m)
Memory: O(1)
