https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's 
anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
		   [0123456789]
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]


Example 2:
           
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]


Constraints:

1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104
s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

Solutions

Sliding window:

Traverse once over the string and check using a bucket if the current
substring from a to b contains all the required characters.
