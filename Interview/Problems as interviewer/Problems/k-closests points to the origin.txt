https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/solution/

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] 
represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, 
return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]


Constraints:
1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
-104 < xi, yi < 104


Solutions:

Using a heap to store at most k nodes
Runtime: O(nlogk)
Memory: O(k)

where n is the number of all the nodes and k the number of the closests k nodes

Using merge insertion
O(n) but in the worst case O(n^2) unlikely
